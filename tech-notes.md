# Scattered technology notes


## Prerequisite for serious work: version control

- `git` is the most widely used and probably best supported version control system today.
    - github's [guide to git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
    - here's my youtube intro to [using `git` from the command line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQXE8E0U9a8)
    - (if you are using an editor like VS Code, you can work on a repository from the VS Code interface without using the command line)
    - [what `xkcd` has to say about git](https://xkcd.com/1597/) (This is actually not bad advice!)


## Writing prose


- Markdown is the plain-text format you want to know: [learn it in 60 seconds](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- Pandoc is the [universal document converter](https://pandoc.org)


## Editors

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com): widely used editor with plugin architecture to support all kinds of editing. (Includes things like CoPilot for vibe coding.)

## Integrated publishing

- [quarto](https://quarto.org): "an open-source scientific and technical publishing system". Supports labelled code blocks that execute when the document is rendered.
- [quarto pub](https://quartopub.com): publish quarto projects to the web


## Operating systems

There are tons of Linux distros. In general, the common OS core will be equally secure in all of them. Google to find loads of reviews!  Here are some you might consider: they all use `apt` for their package management system. (I strongly prefer it over the other widespread packaging system `rpm` developed by RedHat. In my view, it's not a coincidence that their stock symbol is `RHEL`, because `rpm` is package management hell.)

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org): emphasis on stability and security
- [Arch](https://archlinux.org): minimal lightweight distro
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop): maybe currently most popular for first-time Linux users? Regular (and predictable) release cycle, including cycle of long-term support releases
- [Mint](https://linuxmint.com): another  (maybe more lightweight?) distro popular with new Linux users



(We didn't talk about this but ...)

## Diagrams

- Mermaid, the "markdown of diagrams":
    -[try it interactively on their site](https://mermaid.js.org)
    - editors like VS Code and systems like Quarto recognize mermaid-labelled blocks in markdown documents, so you can embed hand-written diagrams (in addition to embedding any kind of graphics that are generated by code )
